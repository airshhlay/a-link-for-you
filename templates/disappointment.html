    {% block para_text %}I have been dutifully waiting for you to emerge from your shell.<br>
        It is to my greatest displeasure to inform you that my patience has run out.<br>
        I'm afraid you are being forced to decide on a day to meet.<br>
        No, you do not have an option, unless you would like me to whine and sulk every time you try to talk to me.<br><br>
        <i>On second thought, if you want to get out of this, you can buy me sashimi.</i>
