## Introduction

    "Hey, let's meet up soon!"
    "Sure!"


*And it never happens.*


Always find yourself making plans with friends that fall through? Or worse, not even getting to the planning stage?

It's normal. We all lead busy lives.

However, some friends just need that _extra_ push.

It's ok to be annoying sometimes. Make time for the ones that matter, and *make sure they commit to your plans!*

## Current Production Stage

Creating this while simultaneously working on schoolwork is tough.
The https://a-link-for-you.herokuapp.com[current deployment] is an extremely simplified version of what I'm planning to create.

#### Current version:

* Simple GET/POST forms and HTML template rendering
* Using W3-CSS template for ease of use

#### Planned changes:

* User functionality to view all your created requests to different friends
* Database integration to hold and store user data, as well as created requests
* A special link for each request
* Upon logging in, check if your friends have filled up the form
* Sort planned meetups according to date
* Create customised forms and immutable form fields (eg. set a date that cannot be changed)
* Use a better CSS template, and make use of better Flask and Python practices
* Might use a REACT frontend and Flask backend using REST practices
